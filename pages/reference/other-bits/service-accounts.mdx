## Service Accounts

### Overview
The Service Accounts API lets you manage your service accounts programmatically. You can get a list of your organizations service accounts, see when they were last used, see when they expire, create new service accounts, delete service accounts, and add/remove service accounts to/from projects. This API is useful for automated key management and rotation.
