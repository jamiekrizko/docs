The Mixpanel Export Data APIs allow you to export your events as JSON either manually or on a schedule.

Note: if you want to continuously export to a cloud storage bucket or data warehouse,  we recommend using our [Data Pipelines](/docs/other-bits/data-pipelines) add-on, which is more scalable and automatically managed.

## Usage
This API uses Project Secret for authentication.
