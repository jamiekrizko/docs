Lookup Tables are mutable tables that describe non-user entities like accounts, a media catalog, or geographies. This API supports replacing the contents of an existing Lookup Table, which can be used to keep Mixpanel in sync with a source-of-truth system.

These APIs use [Service Accounts](ref:service-accounts) for authentication.

## Replace Lookup Table
Lookup Tables must be [created via our UI](/docs/tracking/how-tos/lookup-tables). Once a Lookup Table is created, its contents can be replaced via this API.

### Validation
* The first column of the lookup table is assumed to be the ID of the row. All ID values must be unique.
* The first row of the lookup table is a header row. The values in the header must be unique, as each one uniquely identifies a column of the table. These will appear as properties of the lookup table in Mixpanel's UI.
* The CSV must be valid according to RFC4180.
* If the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header is supplied, the table will be decompressed before parsing.

#### Types
* Integers or floats will be parsed as numbers.
* RFC3339 timestamps (`2021-08-21T05:36:01Z`) will parsed as datetimes.
* `true` or `false` (case-insensitive) will be parsed as boolean.
* Empty fields (two adjacent commas) will be treated as `undefined`
* Comma separated, quoted strings in square brackets (`"[""Free"",""Paid"",""Enterprise""]"`) will be parsed as list of strings.
* All other values will be treated as strings.

### Limits
This endpoint will return a 429 error if called more than 100 times in a rolling 24 hour window. We recommend updating lookup tables at most hourly to stay within this limit.

This endpoint will return a 413 error if a Lookup Table exceeds 100MB uncompressed. In practice, this translates to 1-2M rows. If you have a lookup table that exceeds the limit, we recommend pruning the number of columns to those that are useful to analysis. Removing long URLs or user-generated content can bring a lookup table within this limit. If you still exceed the limit, please reach out to us at apis@mixpanel.com -- we'd love to hear your use case!

## List Lookup Tables
This API returns the list of Lookup Tables in your project.
